## Solution Overview

JBoss EAP is an open source platform for highly transactional, web-scale Java applications. EAP combines the familiar and popular Jakarta EE specifications with the latest technologies, like Microprofile, to modernize your applications from traditional Java EE into the new world of DevOps, cloud, containers, and microservices. EAP includes everything needed to build, run, deploy, and manage enterprise Java applications in a variety of environments, including on-premise, virtual environments, and in private, public, and hybrid clouds.

This template creates two JBoss EAP Instances running inside a VNet and each server is in itâ€™s own subnet. Both the servers are added to the backend pool of a Load Balancer.

## Template Solution Architecture

This template creates all of the compute resources to run EAP 7.2 on top of RHEL 8.0 VMs which are added to the backend pool of a Load Banlancer. Following are the resources deployed:

- 2 RHEL 8.0 VMs
- 1 Load balancer
- Virtual Network with 2 subnets
- EAP 7.2 on RHEL 8.0
- Sample application deployed to JBoss EAP 7

    - Leave the rest of the Parameter Value as it is and proceed.
    
## Deployment Time 

The deployment takes approx. 10 minutes to complete.

## Post Deployment Steps

- Once the deployment is successfull, go to the VM and copy the Public IP of the VM which is the Public IP of the Load Balancer.
- Open a web browser and go to **http://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>** and you should see the web page:
